# Codebreaker

An online game, using an Android-based client, that allows pairs of players to play a game resembling Mastermind: One player selects a code, then the other player submits guesses until the code is found, or until time expires. If the second player does guess the first player's code, then that player chooses a new code, and the first player has to guess. The winner of the match is the one who requires the fewest guesses; if both players take the same number of guesses, then the the player requiring the least amount of time is the winner.
